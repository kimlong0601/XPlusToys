                            Pinky got its name from when it first arrived on Earth. It crash landed in the vibrant pink-hued neon of a red-light district. Space Cyclop's camouflage themselves to blend in, so what better color than hot-blush for such a seedy place?

                        <p>For reasons unknown, Pinky hates crabs (of the aquatic kind), but no one quite knows why.</p>

                            It usually spends its time these days as a hardworking mascot, doing what it can to help out at X-Plus.

                            Having landed in a particularly lush jungle, it adopted the name for itself, along with the protective, natural camouflage.

                            While a bit of a show off, it does so in good cheer and is always kind to others.

                            Having landed in a jungle when it first arrived, it is most certainly an adventurous, outdoors-y type, and is particularly comfortable when camping alone.

                        <p>
                        Its favorite food is pineapple flavored chinsuko, an Okinawan shortbread. It secretly dreams of appearing in a monster movie.

                            Corny got its particular coloration from when it flew into a cornfield in Hokkaido and ate as much of the delicious crop as it could.

                        <p> 
                            Corny longed for the city and eventually found itself in Osaka. The city was so noisy that its eyes turned into a menacing stare to ward off any obnoxious people. A shame that its eyes lost its beautiful blue tones.</p>
                        <p>
                            A bit of a fashionista, Corny wishes that it could open a store in Ame-mura, a bustling American themed shopping hub of Osaka.

                            Toxic fell into some hazardous waste when it first arrived on Earth. The goop ended up turning Toxic a rich purple color, like the waste it was dunked in.

                            While maybe unrelated (or not given the name), this Cyclop has a very brash and outspoken temperament. On top of that, it loves video games, particularly competitive FPS ones.

                        <p>
                            Jungle regularly invites Toxic to go camping, but Toxic doesnâ€™t really enjoy all that nature stuff.
